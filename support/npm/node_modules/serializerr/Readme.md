# serializerr

Convert Errors & Objects into an easily-serialized vanilla Object.

Resulting object has a flattened prototype chain & includes
non-enumerable properties. Ignores properties on `Object.prototype`.

## Why

If you've ever tried to send an Error over a JSON-encoded connection
you've probably been surprised to find all the useful information is
sapped out of it; all the juicy properties like `name`, `message` &
`stack` are non-enumerable thus they are not included in the
stringified JSON. This may be non-standard behaviour, as I could not
locate any mention in either the ES5.1 or the ES6 spec about it, but
Error properties are non-enumerable both in V8 (Chrome/io.js/Node.js) &
SpiderMonkey (Firefox).

I believe Error property non-enumerability was added as a security
measure to prevent stack traces and other sensitive information
accidentally leaking, but it's not uncommon to actually want to send
the data in Error objects over the wire.

`serializerr` makes an Object suitable for serializing to & from
JSON. Not restricted to use with Errors, will work with any Object.

## Installation

```
npm install serializerr
```

## Usage

`serializerr` creates a vanilla Object with the prototype chain
flattened & any non-enumberable properties as regular enumerable properties.
This allows it to be serialised to JSON without losing important data.

```js

var wellSerializedError = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(
  serializerr(error)
))

console.log(wellSerializedError.name) // Error
console.log(wellSerializedError.message) // an error occurred
console.log(wellSerializedError.stack) // Error: an error occurred\n  at Test.<anonymous> ...

```

## Example

```js

var serializerr = require('serializerr')

var error = new Error('an error')

// simulate transferring an Error object over the wire as JSON
// without first passing through serializerr
var poorlySerializedError = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(error))

// oh dear:
console.log(poorlySerializedError.name) // undefined
console.log(poorlySerializedError.message) // undefined
console.log(poorlySerializedError.stack) // undefined

// bring forth the serializerr
var errorObject = serializerr(error)

var wellSerializedError = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(errorObject))

// properties are conserved!
console.log(wellSerializedError.name) // Error
console.log(wellSerializedError.message) // an error occurred
console.log(wellSerializedError.stack) // Error: an error occurred\n  at Test.<anonymous> ...

// note errorObject is a vanilla Object, not an Error
errorObject instanceof Error // false
```

## Notes on 'ize' vs 'ise'

Name was selected as programming world is mostly Americanised, and npm
search does not seem to do effective stemming.

This decision came with strong feelings of guilt and shame about what I thought
was blasphemous Americanised spelling, but it turns out this is a
misconception thus I am pardoned:

> The -ize spelling is often incorrectly seen as an Americanism in
> Britain. However, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) recommends -ize
> and notes that the -ise spelling is from French.
