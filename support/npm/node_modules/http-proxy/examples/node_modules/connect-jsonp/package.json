  "readme": "# connect jsonp\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install connect-jsonp\n\n## Config\n\nIn order to facilitate caching as well as avoid downstream middleware conflicts the filter config option\nexists and instructs this module to filter (or not) the callback param from the request url.  This defaults \nto false but can be specified passing either a boolean or the literal {filter: true} to your requires statement.  \nIn is important to note that you will want to filter the callback param if you are planning on using the \nconnect cache middleware.  Furthermore you will also want to ensure that the cache module is after this module \nas the url, including the query string, is used as a key into the cache (thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jmarca\">jmarca</a> \nfor pointing this out).\n\n## Testing\n\n    git submodule update --init\n    make test\n\n## TODOs\n\nCurrent this middleware proxies the res.writeHead method.  This is limiting and will will potentially raise exceptions \nfor apps that simply call end.  \n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 Sean McDaniel\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
