  "readme": "# normalize-git-url\n\nYou have a bunch of Git URLs. You want to convert them to a canonical\nrepresentation, probably for use inside npm so that it doesn't end up creating\na bunch of superfluous cached origins. You use this package.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar ngu = require('normalize-git-url');\nvar normalized = ngu(\"git+ssh://git@github.com:organization/repo.git#hashbrowns\")\n// get back:\n// {\n//   url : \"ssh://git@github.com/organization/repo.git\",\n//   branch : \"hashbrowns\" // did u know hashbrowns are delicious?\n// }\n```\n\n## API\n\nThere's just the one function, and all it takes is a single parameter, a non-normalized Git URL.\n\n### normalizeGitUrl(url)\n\n* `url` {String} The Git URL (very loosely speaking) to be normalized.\n\nReturns an object with the following format:\n\n* `url` {String} The normalized URL.\n* `branch` {String} The treeish to be checked out once the repo at `url` is\n  cloned. It doesn't have to be a branch, but it's a lot easier to intuit what\n  the output is for with that name.\n\n## Limitations\n\nRight now this doesn't try to special-case GitHub too much -- it doesn't ensure\nthat `.git` is added to the end of URLs, it doesn't prefer `https:` over\n`http:` or `ssh:`, it doesn't deal with redirects, and it doesn't try to\nresolve symbolic names to treeish hashcodes. For now, it just tries to account\nfor minor differences in representation.\n",
